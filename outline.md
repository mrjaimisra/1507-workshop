Welcome 1507!

The workshop will be Thursday, July 2nd from 1pm - 4pm at Turing. During the<br>
workshop we will answer any and all questions you have, talk a bit about what<br>
you will expect from the first module, introduce you to the basics of using<br>
the command line (terminal), slack git and GitHub. If you have no idea what <br>
the command line, slack, git, or GitHub are - don't worry. That's why we are<br>
having a workshop!

If you would like to get help setting up your computer, feel free to come to<br>
Turing around 11 am. There will be students hereto help you getting your<br>
machine prepped with the necessary tools. If you are planning on coming early,<br>
please send Lovisa
an email (she was cc:ed in one of the emails Raissa sent out). You are of course<br>
also welcome to come early to work on other things or get help with Pragmatic<br>
Studio or any other things you are working on.
